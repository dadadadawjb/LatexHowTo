# LatexHowTo
A systematic guidance and reference to LaTeX with clean and well-annotated modules.

## Support Features
* So many LaTeX own features, see directly the list of contents in `LatexHowTo.pdf`
* Sub-modularized organization and structure
* Easy-to-manage figures organization, in `./Figures/`
* Selected templates, in `./Templates/`
* Slides with beamer use, in `./SlidesHowTo/`
* Easy-to-use vscode settings for LaTeX use, in `./settings.json`

## Note
Due to so many dependencies included, some features will come into conflict, so the corresponding codes are annotated with `bug exists` annotation.

Most of the features are introduced in [An introduction to LaTeX](https://book.douban.com/subject/24703731/) by [Haiyang Liu](leoliu.pku@gmail.com), which is also the main reference I refer to.
